# .zsh_plugins.txt - antidote plugins file
#

### Overview
#
# The `.zsh_plugins.txt` file is used by antidote to configure Zsh bundles. Bundles are
# just a fancy way of referring to Zsh utilities, frameworks, prompts, or plugins.
# `.zsh_plugins.txt` is used by antidote to generate a static `.zsh_plugins.zsh` file,
# which can then be sourced in your `.zshrc`. You can use this file as a starting point
# for your own config. Strip out instructional comments (ie: lines beginning with a '#')
# and any plugins you don't need, then add what you like and make it yours!
#
# NOTE: Order matters in this file! Some bundles need to be last, and others are
# prerequisites. Read the documentation for the plugins you use to ensure proper
# configuration.
#

### Completions

# With antidote, using Zephyr's completion plugin is recommended. This plugin is meant
# to be run near the TOP of your .zsh_plugins.txt file.

### Prompts

### Utilities
#
# Utilities aren't traditional Zsh plugins - they aren't sourced Zsh scripts. Instead
# they provide commands that can be executed from your terminal session. One good
# example is zsh-bench, which is a utility that benchmarks your Zsh config. Utility
# bundles can often be made available simply with the `kind:path` annotation.

### Final Plugins

# .zsh_plugins.txt file.
